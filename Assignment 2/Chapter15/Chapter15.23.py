# 15.23 (String permutation) Write a recursive function to print all the permutations of a
# string. For example, for the string abc, the printout is:
# abc
# acb
# bac
# bca
# cab
# cba
# (Hint: Define the following two functions. The second function is a helper function.
# def displayPermuation(s):
# def displayPermuationHelper(s1, s2):
# The first function simply invokes displayPermuation(" ", s). The second
# function uses a loop to move a character from s2 to s1 and recursively invokes
# it with a new s1 and s2. The base case is that s2 is empty and prints s1 to the
# console.)
# Write a test program that prompts the user to enter a string and displays all its permutations.

def displayPermuation(s):
    displayPermuationHelper("", s)

def displayPermuationHelper(s1, s2):
    if s2 == '':
        print(s1)
    else:
        for i in range(len(s2)):
            displayPermuationHelper(s1 + s2[i], s2[0:i] + s2[i + 1:len(s2)])

displayPermuation(input("Enter a string: "))
