# (Check password) Some Web sites impose certain rules for passwords. Write a
# function that checks whether a string is a valid password. Suppose the password
# rules are as follows:
# ■ A password must have at least eight characters.
# ■ A password must consist of only letters and digits.
# ■ A password must contain at least two digits.
# Write a program that prompts the user to enter a password and displays valid
# password if the rules are followed or invalid password otherwise.
