# Write a program that prompts the user to enter the studentsâ€™
# names and their scores on one line, and prints student names in increasing order
# of their scores. (Hint: Create a list. Each element in the list is a sublist with two
# elements: score and name. Apply the sort method to sort the list. This will sort
# the list on scores.)
