# (The Account clasDesigns)  a class named Account that contains:
# ■ A private int data field named id for the account.
# ■ A private float data field named balance for the account.
# ■ A private float data field named annualInterestRate that stores the current
# interest rate.
# ■ A constructor that creates an account with the specified id (default 0), initial
# balance (default 100), and annual interest rate (default 0).
# ■ The accessor and mutator methods for id, balance, and annualInterestRate.

# ■ A method named getMonthlyInterestRate() that returns the monthly
# interest rate.
# ■ A method named getMonthlyInterest() that returns the monthly interest.
# ■ A method named withdraw that withdraws a specified amount from the
# account.
# ■ A method named deposit that deposits a specified amount to the account.
# Draw the UML diagram for the class, and then implement the class. (Hint: The
# method getMonthlyInterest() is to return the monthly interest amount, not
# the interest rate. Use this formula to calculate the monthly interest: balance *
# monthlyInterestRate. monthlyInterestRate is annualInterestRate
# / 12. Note that annualInterestRate is a percent (like 4.5%). You need to
# divide it by 100.)
# Write a test program that creates an Account object with an account id of 1122, a
# balance of $20,000, and an annual interest rate of 4.5%. Use the withdraw
# method to withdraw $2,500, use the deposit method to deposit $3,000, and print
# the id, balance, monthly interest rate, and monthly interest.
